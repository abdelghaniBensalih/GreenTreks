                <p>
                    GreenTreks was founded by two eco-conscious explorers passionate about travel and giving back. It started in a High Atlas Mountains village, where they embraced sustainable travel by connecting with the local Amazigh culture, exploring nature, and supporting community projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inspired by Morocco's beauty, GreenTreks now curates unique journeys across the country, from serene Atlantic beaches to vibrant medinas. Each trip immerses travelers in authentic Moroccan experiences, blending adventure, culture, and impactful volunteer projects.
                </p>
